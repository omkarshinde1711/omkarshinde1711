## 🚀 About Me

I'm a detail-oriented and highly caffeinated computer science student with a love for building, breaking, and fixing things — in that order.

From full-stack web apps to distributed deep learning models, I love exploring both the **frontend finesse** and the **backend brains** of software development. I also moonlight as a designer — visuals matter too!

Currently:
- 📚 Learning, building, and contributing through projects, internships, and open-source
- 🔄 Syncing my LeetCode & SQL solutions to GitHub (because automation = life)
- 🤓 Chasing big goals with small commits
